We're excited to announce the release of spin aka v0.4.0, the latest version of Fermyon Wasm Functions!

This release focuses on making your development experience smoother, especially when collaborating with teammates and deploying your applications. Here’s what’s new:

### ✨ What's New in v0.4.0
* Cleaner, More Consistent Commands
We've refined the sub-command structure and standardized flag names, so it's easier to learn and use `spin aka` day-to-day.

* App Linking for Collaboration
Working with others on the same app? [App linking](app-linking.md) now makes it simpler to coordinate and develop together without stepping on each other’s toes.

* Friendlier Error Messages and Help Text
When things go wrong (or if you just need a reminder), you’ll now see clearer, more actionable messages and improved command help.

* Improved Deployment Flow
Deploying your app is now more interactive, guiding you through the process for a smoother experience.

Existing users can get started by upgrading your `spin aka` plugin or sign-up for Fermyon Wasm Functions today.
