Before You Deploy

Youâ€™ll need to configure SpinKube - the open source developer tool
for running Wasm app workloads in Kubernetes, and the necessary
prerequisites documented here.

Deploy

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://
raw.githubusercontent.com/<ghorg>/<suh-example-
name>/main/config/samples/<example-name>.yaml
```
